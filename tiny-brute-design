Tiny Brute static site generator - design

Design requirements:
 - pure html templates - no other templating language
 - No content information collected or understood by Tiny Brute, e.g. it knows nothing about published dates. All the content knowledge is in the client code.

Process:
Tiny Brute recursively scans the input directory.
When a file that corresponds to a static web-page is found
 - the file is parsed as YAML
 - a template is selected as indicated in the YAML
 - content from the page content is injected into the template
 - any global-content-injectors that apply to that page are executed
 - the generated html page is copied to the same relative location in the output directory
When a file that does not correspond to a static web-page is found
 - the file is copied directly to the same relative location in the output directory

Static web pages:
The default extension for files that correspond to a static web-page is .page.brute
The client can define a different extension.
Example file...

# When defined with a relative path like this, the path is assumed to be relative to the PROJECT_DIRECTORY
template = blog-post.html

# Anything other than the template is assumed to be a content-injection definition
[main-image]
path = 'body #main-image'
content = '''
main-content = """
This is the best blog post I've ever written.
If I knew it was going to be this good, I would have started a blog to put it in
